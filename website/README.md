# Wflo Documentation Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static hosting service.

## Deployment

The site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

To manually deploy:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```
